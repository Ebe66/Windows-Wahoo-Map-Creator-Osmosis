Bolt2-Mapsforge-VTM-Rendertheme
=============
This vtm-Rendertheme is based on the original from Wahoo. It will work on the Wahoo **Bolt2** and **Roam2** (heavily tested) and the original Roam (not tested in lack of the deivce). It is not intended to be used with the the original Bolt 1 and ELEMNT.

Press response
-------------
I published an article in the German [c't Magazin](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2022/26/2230710050673252243). It discribes the process of creating maps and some basics for adjusting the rendering theme.

Usage
-------------
* connect MTP via usb
* create the directory `maps\vtm-elemnt`
* copy files via Explorer to the Bolt
